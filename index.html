  <div class=".about-me"><h2>About</h2>
  <p>Welcome to My Portfolio. A little about myself, I currently reside in the greater Seattle area. I have spent the last decade working in the restaurant industry striving to build and improve my <b>social</b> and <b>personal skills</b>, aswell as <b>hard work ethic</b>. Living in the city has it's perks but I'm happiest by the beach or in the mountains and forests of our beautiful state. When I'm not studying or working I like to spend my time with my wife and two cats; Mars & Mercury. I started this journey into programming to challenge myself and in the end hopefully contribute great products and creative problem solving to the Web Development industry. </p></div>
